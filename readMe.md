## Address Book Web App

This project was the first functioning webpage that I designed in August 2021. The webpage allows users to add, edit and delete contacts (the data does not persist). I used a combination of HTML, JavaScript and CSS, alongside the JS library JQuery.

# How to use

After cloning the repo, opening the index.html file using chrome should bring you to the web app.
